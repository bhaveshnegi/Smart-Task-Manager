# Smart Task Management App with Gamification

## Description

Create a task management app that combines productivity tools with gamification elements to motivate users. The app could feature:

- **Collaborative Features**: Users can create shared task boards for group projects and assign tasks to teammates.
- **Analytics**: Provide users with insights on their productivity trends (e.g., best days/times for getting work done).
- **Notification System**: Reminders and push notifications to keep users on track.
